## What is Hugo

Hugo is a SSG written in the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/). Go is a language designed at Google.

According to [gohugo.io](https://gohugo.io/) Hugo is

<blockquote>The worldâ€™s fastest framework for building websites</blockquote>

Let's see what Google PageSpeed thinks.

### Criteria

I selected a Hugo themedemo site that was:

1. Updated recently.
2. Looked contemporary.
3. Classified as fast.
4. Classified as minimal.

[Meghna Huga](https://themes.gohugo.io/meghna-hugo/) fit the bill, so I ran with that.
